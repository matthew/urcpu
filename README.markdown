About
=====

UrCPU is a virtual CPU for running
[UrScheme](http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/sw/urscheme). UrCPU takes the x86
GNU Assembly output from UrScheme, parses it, and interprets the assembly
instructions. UrCPU is intended only to be powerful enough to run UrScheme and
it is not a general purpose virtualized x86 CPU or assembler.

UrCPU is primarily a pedagogical exercise in learning x86 assembly and the
internals of a self-hosting Scheme compiler.
